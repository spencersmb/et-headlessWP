            <description><![CDATA[One major change that came with Procreate&#8217;s last update was masking.

            <description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve only recently started incorporating Illustrator texture brushes into my work, and I regret not doing it sooner! Illustrator texture brushes offer so much hand made feel with such little effort, you almost feel like a magician 😉 To get started, all you need is any kind of vector texture like this set of inky [&hellip;]

            <title><![CDATA[5 Simple (but impressive!) DIY Embossing Ideas]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[On Tuesday, we got crafty with mixing watercolors with diy embossing. In my opinion, this is one the most self-satisfying diy design/craft activities out there. There&#8217;s something about watching that embossing powder come to life with heat, and it&#8217;s literally eye candy every time. Today I&#8217;m sharing 5 simple, (but impressive!) DIY embossing ideas that will [&hellip;]

            <title><![CDATA[Create Watercolor Lettering with DIY Embossing 3 Ways]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[I think it&#8217;s pretty fair to say that diy embossing is reallllly popular right now. It&#8217;s easy to see why; First, there&#8217;s watching colorful powder stick magically to invisible ink. Next, there&#8217;s witnessing it look completely different (especially metallics) once heat is applied. The results look like they came from a pro print shop! I haven&#8217;t come across [&hellip;]

It might just be the cuteness factor, but serious planning goes into hierarchy and layout in such a small space, and that has always been really impressive to me. Do you ever check what the clothing tags look like when you&#8217;re shopping? I remember the first time [&hellip;]

Since we went over typing on a path in Illustrator on Tuesday, I thought it&#8217;d be fun to mix the concept of custom baselines with purely typographic layouts. The results are pretty incredible and can for sure seem intimidating to try yourself.

You&#8217;re probably already familiar with the ability to select any text and go effect &gt; warp, but that makes editing your text later on pretty difficult. The truth is, most of graphic design is experimenting, altering and adjusting. Because of this, [&hellip;]

We also called all of the graphic elements the brand&#8217;s VIS, or visual identity system. I&#8217;ve seen (online, anyway), it&#8217;s commonly referred to as a brand style guide, so we&#8217;re using that for this post. [&hellip;]

            <description><![CDATA[This week&#8217;s tutorial comes courtesy of Kori, who requested an overview of the Illustrator Pathfinder Palette and I thought it was a great idea!
